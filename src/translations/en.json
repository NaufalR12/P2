  "timelineTitle": "Development History",
  "timeline1Year": "Mataram Era",
  "timeline1Title": "A Rich Historical Heritage",
  "timeline1Desc1": "Pujokusuman Village holds a long historical trace from the Mataram Sultanate era. This area was originally not owned by GBPH Pujokusuman, but was the residence of Prince Dipokusumo, an important figure of that era. Digital data and archives now stored in the Leiden University collection mention the official handover of this area from another prince (allegedly still within the royal circle) to Prince Dipokusumo, who was the son of Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono VIII.",
  "timeline1Desc2": "At that time, the Yogyakarta Palace had developed and the center of power had moved to the Alun-Alun Utara area, making the surrounding area a base for nobles and loyal followers of the sultanate. This village gradually developed into an important hub for cultural activities and palace defense.",
  "timeline2Year": "Independence Era",
  "timeline2Title": "Hantu Maut and Guerrilla Traces",
  "timeline2Desc1": "Entering the independence era, Pujokusuman Village was known not only for its cultural values but also for its real contribution to the struggle of the people of Yogyakarta. During the reign of Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, a people's fighter group called the Hantu Maut Troop was formed. The name was given because of their guerrilla strategy carried out at night — sneaking through Dutch-era ditches and tunnels, some of which still exist around Pratama Hospital.",
  "timeline2Desc2": "Initially, villages around Pujokusuman such as Keparakan and Brontokusuman formed their own people's troops. But in 1949, these groups merged and Pujokusuman became the main base of the Hantu Maut Troop. One of the secret routes they used is said to still be traceable — including tunnels under the wavy road at the zero kilometer point. In this place, many old air holes and lamp fittings have been found, which are believed to have been part of the underground hiding route.",
  "timeline2Desc3": "One legendary story from this era comes from Doro Pujo, a central figure from the Pujokusuman noble family. To support the people's struggle, he handed over a kris to be exchanged for logistics for the fighters' public kitchen in Keparakan.",
  "timeline2Desc4": "Another important figure is Romo Ditik Suhardi, a young fighter aged 15 who was once sent to the battlefield in Ambarawa and was a political prisoner. During his exile, he met and became close to the Doro Pujo family. From this relationship, Romo Ditik later married the younger sister of Doro Pujo's wife. From this couple were born two influential figures in the cultural life of this village: Romo Ibnu Suhardi and Romo Titik.",
  "timeline3Year": "Modern Era",
  "timeline3Title": "Preserving Tradition Amidst Change",
  "timeline3Desc1": "Today, Pujokusuman Village continues to preserve the cultural heritage that has been rooted for hundreds of years. In this village stands Sanggar Wabanah, an organization pioneered by Romo Ibnu Suhardi, which focuses on exploring local culture and discussions about the development of world culture and technology.",

  "budaya1Title": "Traditional Dance Studio",
  "budaya1Sejarah1": "Ndalem Pujokusuman is not just a cultural heritage building. It is a living heirloom that forms the physical and spiritual foundation for the classical Yogyakarta dance tradition. Located in Keparakan Village, Mergangsan District, Yogyakarta City, this building has witnessed the city's journey from the sultanate era, the struggle for independence, to the modern era as a center for cultural arts development.",
  "budaya1Sejarah2": "The building now known as Ndalem Pujokusuman was originally called Ndalem Danudiningrat, the residence of KRT Danudiningrat, son-in-law of Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwana VII. In 1901, this house officially changed ownership to GBPH Pujokusumo, one of the sons of Sultan Hamengku Buwana VIII. The direct connection to the royal bloodline makes this house not only prestigious socially, but also rich in culture.",
  "budaya1Sejarah3": "As an important figure in the Palace, GBPH Pujokusumo served as the head of Kridhamardawa — the official dance institution under the Yogyakarta Sultanate. His love for dance made this house a center for training and passing on classical movement arts full of philosophy and aesthetics. From here, the seeds of the dance studio grew, in line with the spiritual aura and cultural legitimacy of the owner.",
  "budaya1Sejarah4": "Uniquely, Ndalem Pujokusuman not only reflects the gentleness of culture, but also once became a fortress of struggle. During the physical revolution, this building was used as the headquarters of the Hantu Maut guerrilla troops who operated at night. GBPH Pujokusumo was also known as a fierce fighter against the colonizers — a duality strongly attached to the character of the village and this house: gentle in art, tough in struggle.",
  "budaya1Sejarah5": "Recognition of the cultural role of this house grew stronger when in 2011, the Provincial Government of DIY officially designated Ndalem Pujokusuman as the Center for Yogyakarta Style Dance Arts. This was not just an administrative decision, but an affirmation of the historical and cultural reality that has existed for decades.",
  "budaya1Sejarah6": "Dance activities at Ndalem Pujokusuman began with a small community called Mardawa Budaya. Contrary to popular belief, this group was born from a cross-cultural spirit. One of its key figures was Honsche, a British citizen interested in classical Javanese dance. Honsche's presence shows that from the beginning, Ndalem Pujokusuman has been open to the outside world — making it a living intercultural space.",
  "budaya1Sejarah7": "Mardawa Budaya focused on dance education for children and youth, realizing the importance of early regeneration. This group slowly grew and became structured, eventually transforming into the Sasminta Mardawa Dance Learning Foundation (YPBSM).",
  "budaya1Sejarah8": "This transformation was triggered by the important moment of GBPH Pujokusumo's death in 1961. Before passing away, he left a message to his son, KRT Sasminta Dipura (Romo Sas), to establish a formal foundation for learning various types of dance. This mandate became the basis for the establishment of YPBSM, which to this day is home to the preservation of Yogyakarta style classical dance.",
  "budaya1Sejarah9": "YPBSM stands on two strengths: bottom-up community initiative that provides collective spirit, authenticity, and cross-cultural openness, and top-down authoritative support through the royal bloodline, which gives traditional legitimacy and direct access to sources of classical dance knowledge.",
  "budaya1Sejarah10": "Romo Sas is the central figure who bridges both — an artist who also holds a mandate. His role strengthens YPBSM's position as a dance institution that not only has strong community roots, but also has traditional authority from within the palace environment.",
  "budaya1Sejarah11": "Now, the dance studio at Ndalem Pujokusuman continues to play an active role in classical dance training, performances, workshops, and the regeneration of young artists. Every dance movement taught here carries hundreds of years of history, while also opening space for new developments in the digital and global era.",
  "budaya1Sejarah12": "Ndalem Pujokusuman is not just a training place — it is a spiritual space, where noble values, aesthetics, and nationalism meet. A cultural home that remains alive, relevant, and deeply rooted in the hearts of the Yogyakarta community.",
  "budaya1Deskripsi": "In this studio, children and teenagers learn various types of traditional Javanese dances such as Srimpi, Bedhaya, Gambyong, and other folk dances. Training is conducted by senior puppeteers and dancers with decades of experience.",

  "budaya2Sejarah": "Jemparingan is a traditional Javanese archery art that originated from the Mataram Kingdom era. In Pujokusuman, this tradition was revived in 2000 as an effort to preserve ancestral culture.",
  "budaya2Deskripsi": "Jemparingan uses bamboo bows and wooden arrows with a target made of leather. The philosophy of jemparingan teaches about inner calm, focus, and life balance.",
