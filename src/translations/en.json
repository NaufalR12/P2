  "timeline1Year": "Mataram Era",
  "timeline1Title": "A Rich Historical Heritage",
  "timeline1Desc1": "Pujokusuman Village holds a long historical trace from the Mataram Sultanate era. This area was originally not owned by GBPH Pujokusuman, but was the residence of Prince Dipokusumo, an important figure of that era. Digital data and archives now stored in the Leiden University collection mention the official handover of this area from another prince (allegedly still within the royal circle) to Prince Dipokusumo, who was the son of Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono VIII.",
  "timeline1Desc2": "At that time, the Yogyakarta Palace had developed and the center of power had moved to the Alun-Alun Utara area, making the surrounding area a base for nobles and loyal followers of the sultanate. This village gradually developed into an important hub for cultural activities and palace defense.",
  "timeline2Year": "Independence Era",
  "timeline2Title": "Hantu Maut and Guerrilla Traces",
  "timeline2Desc1": "Entering the independence era, Pujokusuman Village was known not only for its cultural values but also for its real contribution to the struggle of the people of Yogyakarta. During the reign of Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, a people's fighter group called the Hantu Maut Troop was formed. The name was given because of their guerrilla strategy carried out at night — sneaking through Dutch-era ditches and tunnels, some of which still exist around Pratama Hospital.",
  "timeline2Desc2": "Initially, villages around Pujokusuman such as Keparakan and Brontokusuman formed their own people's troops. But in 1949, these groups merged and Pujokusuman became the main base of the Hantu Maut Troop. One of the secret routes they used is said to still be traceable — including tunnels under the wavy road at the zero kilometer point. In this place, many old air holes and lamp fittings have been found, which are believed to have been part of the underground hiding route.",
  "timeline2Desc3": "One legendary story from this era comes from Doro Pujo, a central figure from the Pujokusuman noble family. To support the people's struggle, he handed over a kris to be exchanged for logistics for the fighters' public kitchen in Keparakan.",
  "timeline2Desc4": "Another important figure is Romo Ditik Suhardi, a young fighter aged 15 who was once sent to the battlefield in Ambarawa and was a political prisoner. During his exile, he met and became close to the Doro Pujo family. From this relationship, Romo Ditik later married the younger sister of Doro Pujo's wife. From this couple were born two influential figures in the cultural life of this village: Romo Ibnu Suhardi and Romo Titik.",
  "timeline3Year": "Modern Era",
  "timeline3Title": "Preserving Tradition Amidst Change",
  "timeline3Desc1": "Today, Pujokusuman Village continues to preserve the cultural heritage that has been rooted for hundreds of years. In this village stands Sanggar Wabanah, an organization pioneered by Romo Ibnu Suhardi, which focuses on exploring local culture and discussions about the development of world culture and technology.",

Today, through the Sasminta Mardawa Dance Learning Foundation (YPBSM), this studio continues to preserve hundreds of years of historical heritage while opening space for new developments in the modern era.",
  "budaya2SejarahSingkat": "Jemparingan is a traditional Mataram archery art known as Mataram-style archery. Unlike modern archery, jemparingan is performed sitting cross-legged (lesehan) while wearing traditional Javanese clothing, and using traditional equipment made from natural materials.\nJemparingan is not just a sport — but also cultural heritage, emotional cultivation, and character education that lives and is passed down across generations.",
  "budaya3SejarahSingkat": "Jatilan is one of the traditional arts that has long lived and become part of the cultural pulse in Pujokusuman Village. Although not precisely recorded when this group was established, Jatilan performances have become both entertainment and guidance familiar to the community.",

As a village designated as a Culture Village, Pujokusuman has fertile ground for the growth of arts communities deeply rooted in local values and citizen participation.",
  "budaya5SejarahSingkat": "The ruwatan tradition in Pujokusuman has been passed down for hundreds of years. This ceremony is a spiritual cleansing ritual according to Javanese beliefs to ward off misfortune and bring safety. Ruwatan is performed with an all-night wayang kulit performance led by a senior puppeteer, usually presenting Lakon Murwakala or stories of liberation from curses.",

  "budaya1Title": "Traditional Dance Studio",
  "budaya1Sejarah1": "Ndalem Pujokusuman is not just a cultural heritage building. It is a living heirloom that becomes the physical and spiritual foundation for the Yogyakarta-style classical dance tradition. Located in Keparakan Village, Mergangsan District, Yogyakarta City, this building witnesses the city's journey from the sultanate era, independence struggle, to the modern era as a center for arts and culture development.",
  "budaya1Sejarah2": "The building now known as Ndalem Pujokusuman was originally called Ndalem Danudiningrat, the residence of KRT Danudiningrat, son-in-law of Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwana VII. In 1901, this palace officially changed ownership to GBPH Pujokusumo, one of the sons of Sultan Hamengku Buwana VIII. The direct connection to the royal bloodline makes this palace not only socially prestigious but also culturally rich.",
  "budaya1Sejarah3": "As an important figure in the Palace environment, GBPH Pujokusumo served as the leader of Kridhamardawa — the official dance institution under the Yogyakarta Sultanate. His love for dance made this palace no different from a training center and inheritance of classical movement arts full of philosophy and aesthetics. From here, the seeds of the dance studio grew, in line with the spiritual aura and cultural legitimacy of the owner.",
  "budaya1Sejarah4": "Uniquely, Ndalem Pujokusuman not only reflects the gentleness of culture but also once became a fortress of struggle. During the physical revolution, this building functioned as the Headquarters of the Hantu Maut guerrilla troops who operated at night. GBPH Pujokusumo was also known as a stubborn fighter against the colonizers — a duality strongly attached to the character of this village and palace: gentle in art, tough in struggle.",
  "budaya1Sejarah5": "Recognition of the cultural role of this palace grew stronger when in 2011, the DIY Provincial Government officially designated Ndalem Pujokusuman as the Center for Yogyakarta Style Dance Arts. This was not merely an administrative decision but an affirmation of the historical and cultural reality that had been ongoing for decades.",
  "budaya1Sejarah6": "Dance activities at Ndalem Pujokusuman began with a small community called Mardawa Budaya. Different from common perceptions, this group was born from a cross-cultural spirit. One of its important figures was Honsche, a British citizen interested in classical Javanese dance. Honsche's presence shows that from the beginning, Ndalem Pujokusuman was open to the outside world — making it a living intercultural space.",
  "budaya1Sejarah7": "Mardawa Budaya focused on dance education for children and young people, realizing the importance of early regeneration. This group slowly grew and became structured, eventually transforming into the Sasminta Mardawa Dance Learning Foundation (YPBSM).",
  "budaya1Sejarah8": "This transformation was triggered by the important moment of GBPH Pujokusumo's death in 1961. Before passing away, he left a message to his son, KRT Sasminta Dipura (Romo Sas), to establish a formal foundation that would accommodate learning various types of dance. This mandate became the foundation for the establishment of YPBSM, which to this day remains home to the preservation of Yogyakarta-style classical dance.",
  "budaya1Sejarah9": "YPBSM stands on two strengths: bottom-up community initiative that provides collective spirit, authenticity, and cross-cultural openness, and top-down authoritative support through royal lineage, which provides traditional legitimacy and direct access to sources of classical dance knowledge.",
  "budaya1Sejarah10": "Romo Sas is the central figure who bridges both — an artist who also holds a mandate. His role strengthens YPBSM's position as a dance institution that not only has strong community roots but also has traditional authority from within the palace environment.",
  "budaya1Sejarah11": "Today, the dance studio at Ndalem Pujokusuman continues to play an active role in classical dance training, performances, workshops, and the regeneration of young artists. Every dance movement taught here carries hundreds of years of historical heritage while opening space for new developments in the digital and global era.",
  "budaya1Sejarah12": "Ndalem Pujokusuman is not just a practice place — it is a spiritual space where noble values, aesthetics, and nationalism meet. A cultural home that remains alive, relevant, and deeply rooted in the hearts of the Yogyakarta community.",
  "budaya1Deskripsi": "Strong and diverse Human Resources (HR), with 19 professional instructor artists guiding 350 active students, plus special classes and loyal alumni. This foundation also has a solid institutional history and reputation, located in the historic Ndalem Pujokusuman and recognized as the center of Yogyakarta-style dance arts, resulting from a combination of grassroots initiatives and palace mandates. Dance arts play an important role in the socio-cultural life of residents, functioning as preservation of cultural heritage, informal education space, identity symbol, and social relationship bond. This foundation also upholds rich cultural values and local heritage, reflected in philosophy, movement patterns, ethics, aesthetics, and spiritual dimensions of routine performances. Active local community support through cooperation is also a strength. Additionally, there is great economic potential through cultural tourism, with training fees from students including foreign tourists, and opportunities for integration into cultural village tourism packages.",

  "budaya2Sejarah1": "Jemparingan is a traditional Yogyakarta archery art known as Mataram-style archery. Unlike modern archery, jemparingan is performed sitting cross-legged (lesehan) while wearing traditional Javanese clothing, and using traditional equipment made from natural materials.",
  "budaya2Sejarah2": "Jemparingan is not just a sport — but also cultural heritage, emotional cultivation, and character education that lives and is passed down across generations.",
  "budaya2Sejarah3": "History of Jemparingan\nThis tradition has been known since the Islamic Mataram kingdom era. In the past, jemparingan was practiced by soldiers, nobles, and even royal families to train concentration, accuracy, and noble character. Over time, this tradition spread and could be followed by common people, becoming a symbol of unity and Javanese character formation.",
  "budaya2Sejarah4": "Development of Jemparingan Styles\nGagrag Mataram Ngayogyakarta\nA traditional style where archers do not aim with their eyes but rely on intuition and feeling. The bow (gandewa) is drawn parallel to the chest, then released with distinctive techniques: jegulan, jenthotan, or undlup.",
  "budaya2Sejarah5": "Aiming Style (1953)\nDuring the era of Sri Paduka Pakualam VIII, jemparingan techniques were developed to enter the national sports arena (PON). Archers began to visually aim at targets while maintaining cultural values within.",
  "budaya2Sejarah6": "Mataram Values in Jemparingan\nJemparingan was developed as part of the Yogyakarta Special Region mandate — strengthening Mataram identity and passing down noble Javanese philosophy. This tradition not only maintains cultural forms but also conveys deep messages about equality, responsibility, and spirituality.",
  "budaya2Sejarah7": "How to Play\nCross-legged Sitting Position Tilted to the Left\nArchers sit cross-legged, body slightly sideways to the left, different from modern archery performed standing.",
  "budaya2Sejarah8": "Bow Grip and Arrow Pull\nThe left hand holds the bow (gandewa), the right hand pulls the arrow (jemparing), which is then drawn parallel to the stomach before release.",
  "budaya2Sejarah9": "10–20 Meters\nThe target is a pendulum (wong-wongan)—a wooden/bamboo cylinder about ±30 cm high and 3–5 cm in diameter—placed approximately 10–20 meters in front of the archer.",

  "budaya2Sejarah11": "Mataram Values in Jemparingan\nArchers must wear traditional Javanese clothing, exactly like palace servants:\nFor Men:\nPeranakan clothing: traditional tops, jarik (cloth) layered at the waist (nyamping), and blangkon or udheng as headwear.",

  "budaya2Sejarah14": "Character Education in Jemparingan\nMataram Chivalrous Spirit as taught by Prince Mangkubumi (Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono I):\nGreget – spirit and determination in achieving goals\nNyawiji – unity of mind, heart, and action\nSengguh – self-confidence and optimism\nOra Mingkuh – taking responsibility for one's actions",

  "budaya3Sejarah": "Jathilan Pujokusuman has existed since the 1970s. This art originates from Javanese folk tradition depicting horsemen in battle. The village's Jathilan group is famous even outside the city.",
  "budaya3Sejarah1": "Jatilan is one of the traditional arts that has long lived and become part of the cultural pulse in Pujokusuman Village. Although not precisely recorded when this group was established, Jatilan performances have become both entertainment and guidance familiar to the community. Carrying dynamic rhythms, magical movements, and distinctive Javanese spiritual power, Jatilan in Pujokusuman is not just entertainment but also a space for preserving traditional values and community solidarity.",
  "budaya3Sejarah2": "",
  "budaya3Deskripsi": "In every performance, Jatilan can unite various generations: from children to elderly, whether as players, gamelan players, or audiences who get carried away in the atmosphere. Pujokusuman residents maintain this art independently, making it part of village activities that appear in important events such as earth salvation ceremonies, holiday celebrations, and cultural festivals. Without relying on commercial profits, Jatilan remains sustainable as proof that collective spirit and love for culture are the main forces that keep it alive and moving.",

Teater Obah serves as a platform for young people and the community who want to learn, process, and express social and cultural issues through the theater medium.",
  "budaya4Sejarah3": "Although its achievements are still focused within Yogyakarta, Sanggar Teater Obah has actively participated in various community performances, local festivals, and inter-cultural village collaborations. The name \"Obah,\" meaning \"to move\" in Javanese, reflects this group's spirit to remain dynamic, explore local potential, and enliven public spaces through reflective and grounded theater performances. More than just performances, this theater is a space for collective learning and the village's way of voicing its thoughts.",
  "budaya4Deskripsi": "Sanggar Teater Obah is a performing arts community born in Pujokusuman Culture Village, Yogyakarta, since 2019.

  "budaya5Title": "Ruwahan",
  "budaya5Sejarah": "In Pujokusuman Village, Ruwahan is not just a ritual to remember ancestors but also a spiritual traditional celebration similar to the atmosphere of Maulid Nabi. Conducted before Ramadan, the Ruwahan tradition becomes a sacred moment to gather, pray together, and share meaningful traditional foods—especially apem cake.",
  "budaya5Sejarah1": "Apem cake in the Ruwahan tradition is not just an ordinary treat. It symbolizes forgiveness and self-purification. In Javanese, the word apem comes from 'afwan' in Arabic, meaning 'forgiveness' or 'pardon'. So when residents share apem cake in the Ruwahan tradition, it becomes a symbol of asking for forgiveness, intention to cleanse oneself before entering the holy month, and a form of love and social solidarity among residents.",
  "budaya5Deskripsi": "This tradition is usually conducted in a solemn and warm atmosphere. Residents bring various types of offerings, including apem and other foods, to be prayed for together. After prayers and tahlil, food is shared among each other—a concrete form of the philosophy of togetherness and mutual prayer among believers.",
  "budaya5Deskripsi1": "Although times have shifted, the Ruwahan tradition in Pujokusuman persists as a living spiritual space. Behind its simplicity, there are noble values preserved across generations: respect for ancestors, spirit of sharing, and hope for a better and cleaner life both physically and spiritually.",

  "budaya6Title": "Pujokusuman Creative Lab",
  "budaya6Sejarah1": "\"From Social Concerns to Creative Community Space\" The Beginning: Starting from Village Reality Pujokusuman Creative Lab (PCL) was born from less-than-ideal social conditions. Around 2019, Karang Taruna Keparakan faced serious challenges — a harsh environment, thuggish culture, and minimal healthy dialogue space for young people. The leadership of Karang Taruna at that time began to realize that formal and regulatory approaches were not enough to address the situation.",
  "budaya6Sejarah2": "In casual conversations with Kotagede youth, clear differences in dynamics were visible. The youth movement in Kotagede was much more alive and productive, with clear direction and space. This sparked young people from Pujokusuman Village to try a new format — not forums, not big events, but a living meeting space every day.",
  "budaya6Sejarah3": "2022: Coffee Shop as Meeting Point The first experiment to establish Pujokusuman Creative Lab began in 2022. The initiators: young people from Pujokusuman themselves. The base: a coffee shop. Not just a coffee place, but a cultural strategy to create an informal space that could be a meeting place, chat, exchange ideas, even work together.",
  "budaya6Sejarah4": "There were about 30 initial stakeholders involved. They came from diverse backgrounds — artists, local activists, literacy enthusiasts, even screen printers. All contributed capital and energy, a kind of social share scheme — not business, but collective ownership.",
  "budaya6Sejarah5": "Fall, Rise, and Learn Together But the initial path wasn't smooth. Strong hanging-out habits actually prevented the envisioned discussions from happening. The built space became more about casual chat but lacked direction and idea sustainability. Until finally an important question emerged: 'Do we want to be just a hangout place? Or become a learning space that truly creates change?'",
  "budaya6Sejarah6": "From there, the idea of \"Citizen School\" was born — a new approach that divided PCL space into two tracks: Academic Track: discussions, citizen classes, village history, social mapping, to citizen media. Non-Academic/Industrial School Track: practical training like making food stalls.",
  "budaya6Sejarah7": "Today: Still Processing, Not Finished PCL is not a finished space. It is still processing. But that's what makes it authentic. At PCL, we learn together — about collaboration, about conflict, about building shared space with all its dynamics.",
  "budaya6Sejarah8": "PCL is not a social startup. Not an NGO either. But an experiment by village youth who want their lives to be relevant in the midst of a rapidly moving city. Here they rearrange their way of learning, way of meeting, and way of managing ideas.",
  "budaya6Deskripsi": "Pujokusuman Creative Lab (PCL) is a resident collaborative space born from social concerns in Pujokusuman Village, Yogyakarta. Established by young people in 2022, PCL started from the desire to build a creative space that is alive and relevant — not just a gathering place, but a collective learning space that grows from village reality. With a coffee shop base as a meeting point, PCL becomes a gathering place for various community elements: artists, activists, literacy enthusiasts, to local creative industry players. From casual conversations to serious discussions, PCL grows through experimentation and collective awareness.",
  "budaya7Title": "Pujokusuman Market",
  "budaya7Sejarah": "Pujokusuman Market is one of the legendary markets located in the heart of the cultural area of Keparakan Village, Mergangsan, Yogyakarta. Its location is very strategic—adjacent to the Ndalem Pujokusuman complex and only about 100 meters from the Pojok Beteng Wetan intersection. This market has become a silent witness to social, economic, and even historical struggle activities of the local community.",
  "budaya7Sejarah1": "With an area of about 352 m², this market building combines European Art Deco architectural style with traditional Javanese architecture, clearly visible from its front facade resembling a small fortress. Despite its small scale, this market completely sells various basic necessities, traditional foods, and spices.",
  "budaya7Sejarah2": "Operating since the 1950s, this market has become an inseparable part of Pujokusuman residents' daily life. Even several traders have been selling here for more than 30 years.",
  "budaya7Sejarah3": "One historical heritage in the middle of the market is a monument commemorating the 2nd Anniversary of Indonesian Independence, built in July 1947, right when the First Dutch Military Aggression erupted. This monument symbolizes the patriotic spirit of Pujokusuman youth who actively participated in the independence struggle. However, during the Second Dutch Military Aggression on December 19, 1948, Pujokusuman youth troops suffered defeat. Nevertheless, the monument still stands firm, marking history amid the market's bustle.",
  "budaya7Sejarah4": "Besides the monument, in this market area there is also an old grave, whose existence still holds big question marks to this day. There is no clear name marker, and no definite record of who is buried there. The grave becomes part of the authentic face of Pujokusuman Market that unites daily activities with layers of past memories.",
  "budaya7Deskripsi": "Pujokusuman Market offers various daily necessities from fresh vegetables, fruits, kitchen spices, to traditional foods. What makes this market special is the family atmosphere between traders and buyers, and the presence of traditional snacks and foods that are difficult to find elsewhere.\n\nWhat's Sold?\n- Fresh vegetables and ingredients\n- Kitchen spices and seasonings\n- Market snacks and traditional treats\n- Ready-to-eat food\n- Meat and chicken\n- Traditional herbal drinks\n\nAccess to Location:\n- From Pojok Beteng Wetan intersection, head north ±100 meters, the market is on the east side of the road, slightly into the alley, behind the Pujokusuman gate.\n- From Brigjen Katamso intersection, head south ±1 kilometer. The market is before reaching Pojok Beteng Wetan intersection.\n\nPujokusuman Market is not just a buying and selling place, but also a living space that combines economic activities and historical traces. Here, traditions, identity, and stories of Keparakan residents continue to beat, day by day.",

  "budaya8Sejarah": "The Kring Man community started in 2016 from something simple: the casual habit of cycling together among residents in Pujokusuman Village. Without grand targets, just starting from the spirit of togetherness and desire to live healthy. Who would have thought, from just going around the village, this community grew into a tough cyclist group exploring city to city. The peak was in 2022, when they successfully made a full bicycle journey to Bali and Kediri, making that journey an extraordinary milestone for this ordinary community.",
  "budaya8Sejarah1": "Now, Kring Man Family is still actively pedaling around Yogyakarta City, although not bound by specific schedules. Togetherness remains the main fuel of this community, gathering, cycling, and enjoying the journey together. Without competitive targets and structural members, they cycle casually but meaningfully—maintaining health, strengthening friendship, and making the roads a space for play and stories. The gathering point is at RT 22, but the spirit has spread, greeting other cities they pass through.",

  "budaya9Title": "Kentongan Orchestra SUKA RENA",
  "budaya9Sejarah": "Kentongan is not just a traditional musical instrument, but also a heritage of people's communication since the independence struggle era. In the past, kentongan was used as a situation marker, giving signals for safe, alert, and danger with certain sound patterns that were agreed upon. Now, the historical and musical value of kentongan continues to be maintained to stay alive in the community.",
  "budaya9Sejarah1": "One manifestation of this preservation is the existence of the Sukorena Kentongan Orchestra in Keparakan Village. This orchestra has been established for quite a while, but has experienced decline because most of its members are elderly or have passed away. To prevent it from becoming just a story of the past, regeneration and support from various parties are needed to revive this art.",
  "budaya9Sejarah2": "One of the activities carried out was the Sukorena Kentongan Orchestra Training on Tuesday, May 28, 2024, held at Pendopo Bima Jaya, Keparakan Village. This activity was attended by resident representatives from four villages in the sub-district area, as a form of collective commitment in preserving tradition.",
  "budaya9Sejarah3": "This training featured two resource persons from Pujokusuman, namely Budi Triono and Danang Rusmandoko, who have long been known as arts and culture activists in Keparakan. The activity was opened by Keparakan Village Head, Yusup Ahbari, followed by material sessions and kentongan beating practice, including exploration of kentongan collaboration with other musical instruments.",
  "budaya9Sejarah4": "Participant enthusiasm was high throughout the training. The hope is that kentongan orchestras can develop again and take strong root in the four villages, adapted to the character, social conditions, and local wisdom of each area. More than just music, kentongan is an echo of identity that connects the past, present, and future of Keparakan residents.",
  "budaya9Deskripsi": "The SUKA RENA Kentongan Orchestra plays various traditional musical instruments such as kentongan, angklung, and bamboo. The music produced creates a lively and spirited atmosphere, often accompanying village events, processions, and art performances.

  "budaya10Title": "POHON Community (Pedjoeang Heritage Pujokusuman)",
  "budaya10Sejarah": "POHON Community, an acronym for Pedjoeang Heritage Pujokusuman, was born from the spirit to explore and preserve the village's historical roots. The word 'pohon' (tree) was chosen not without meaning—in Arabic, tree is a symbol of history, a place where everything takes root and grows. This community works in the field of history, specifically raising forgotten stories of struggle and past memories from Pujokusuman Village.",
  "budaya10Sejarah1": "One of its starting points was a simple meeting at the village hall—formerly an electricity payment place—with an elderly resident born in 1935. He told about his childhood experiences during the Second Dutch Military Aggression, including how he was forced to evacuate to Bantul, and how the Dutch often seized fish he caught in the Code River. These stories sparked the idea to make historical documentaries, digging deeper into the memories of veterans and living witnesses in Pujokusuman. Since 2017, the POHON community began collecting such stories—including from the late Mr. Sutijo, a civilian who directly experienced the revolution and became a witness of the times.",
  "budaya10Sejarah2": "POHON is not just about the past, but about how the current generation cares for the traces left behind. Through documentation, discussions, and archival research, this community strives to ensure that stories from the village do not disappear with time, and can continue to grow as inspiration for the future.",

  "budayaKetoprakSejarahSingkat": "Pujokusuman Village Ketoprak was born from the spirit of community cooperation starting from an art competition between markets throughout Yogyakarta City in 2017.

  "budaya11Title": "Ketoprak",
  "budaya11Sejarah1": "Pujokusuman Village Ketoprak was born from the spirit of community cooperation starting from an art competition between markets throughout Yogyakarta City in 2017. At that time, Pujokusuman Market carried a ketoprak-style fragment performance involving traders as players and surrounding residents as musicians.",
  "budaya11Sejarah2": "The success in that competition sparked the spirit to continue this activity regularly. The residents involved then agreed to form a more structured group, now known as the Catur Manunggal Budoyo Association.",
  "budaya11Sejarah3": "The name 'Catur Manunggal Budoyo' itself has deep philosophical meaning. 'Catur' means four, 'Manunggal' means united, and 'Budoyo' refers to culture. This name reflects the unity of four important elements in ketoprak: story, music, movement, and vocal that unite in one complete performance.",
  "budaya11Sejarah4": "Budi Triono, as the initiator and main trainer, has a vision to make ketoprak a platform for cultural preservation as well as educational entertainment. He invites residents from various professions - from market traders, housewives, to young people - to actively participate in every aspect of the performance.",
  "budaya11Sejarah5": "Regular practices are held in various places in the village, depending on space availability and needs. Sometimes in the pavilion, sometimes in residents' yards, even sometimes in the market area after closing hours. This flexibility of place actually becomes a strength, because it makes ketoprak truly integrated with residents' daily lives.",
  "budaya11Sejarah6": "The repertoire of stories performed is very diverse, from classical Javanese stories like Mahabharata and Ramayana, to local stories close to community life. This approach makes performances relevant and easily understood by audiences from various backgrounds.",
  "budaya11Sejarah7": "Over time, the Catur Manunggal Budoyo Association not only performs for events in their own village, but is also invited to fill various cultural events at sub-district, district, and even city levels. This achievement makes residents proud and further strengthens Pujokusuman's identity as a cultural village.",
  "budaya11Sejarah8": "Now, Pujokusuman ketoprak has become one of the cultural assets that the village is proud of. Its presence not only preserves tradition but also strengthens social bonds among residents through the process of practice and performance together. This is a real example of how tradition can live and develop through active community participation.",
  "budaya11Deskripsi1": "Ketoprak Catur Manunggal Budoyo Association is a form of traditional Javanese performing art that combines drama, gamelan music, dance, and song. This performance tells classical and contemporary stories with dialogue in Javanese, accompanied by gamelan music played directly by village residents.",
  "budaya11Deskripsi2": "What makes Pujokusuman ketoprak special is its strong cooperative character. All aspects of the performance - from directing, acting, music, to costumes - are done independently by residents. There is no commercial profit sharing; everything is purely for cultural preservation and togetherness.",
  "budaya11Deskripsi3": "This ketoprak also serves as an effective educational medium, because the stories performed are rich with moral values and local wisdom. Through performances, residents are not only entertained but also get lessons about history, culture, and life values.",
  "budaya11Jadwal": "Practice every Thursday night, performances according to village event invitations or cultural festivals",
